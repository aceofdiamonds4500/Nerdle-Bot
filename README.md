So far it can get the solution for today, yesterday, and tomorrow from the internet. We plan to implement the actual solving part very soon.

1) "nerd ping" to ping
2) !get_today to print today's solution to console
3) !get_yesterday to do the same for yesterday's
4) !get_tomorrow for tomorrow's solution
